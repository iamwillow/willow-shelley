	<div id="S1">
		<p class="storyElements"> The early morning sun creeps through the window.  It pierces through your dreams of fun and adventure, forcing you awake.  You find yourself cuddled by your mother and seven siblings.  They are all still asleep. </p>
	</div>
	<div id="S1B1" class="B1"><p>You wake them up.</p></div>
	<div id="S1B2" class="B2"><p>You let them sleep.</p></div>
	
	<div id="S2"><p class="storyElements">You let out a loud squeak, waking your family.  Your siblings stretch, yawn, and get ready to play for the day.  Your mother, on the other hand, seems quite unhappy that you so abruptly woke her. In attempts to calm you down, she licks your head.</p></div>
	<div id="S2B1" class="B1"><p>You squirm away.</p></div>
	<div id="S2B2" class="B2"><p>A morning head rub.  Nice!</p></div>
	
	<div id="S3"><p class="storyElements">You begin your days adventure solo.  Leaving your family, you get up and head for your food bowl.  After stuffing your face, you notice the cat door leading outside.  Your mom always told you not to go out it. </p></div>
	<div id="S3B1" class="B1"><p>Heck, mom's asleep.  She won't notice.</p></div>
	<div id="S3B2" class="B2"><p>Mom probably gave that advice for a reason.</p></div>
	
	<div id="S4"><p class="storyElements">After avoiding a morning bath, you race your siblings to the food bowl.  You stuff your face.  But then you notice the cat door leading outside.  Your mom always told you not to go out it.</p></div>
	<div id="S4B1" class="B1"><p>You sneak out when no one's looking.</p></div>
	<div id="S4B2" class="B2"><p>Mom probably gave that advice for a reason.</p></div>
	
		<div id="S5"><p class="storyElements">With a wet head you follow your sibling to the food bowl.  They had already started without you.  By the time you finished eating, they were long gone, playing in a different room. Then you notice the cat door leading outside.</p></div>
	<div id="S5B1" class="B1"><p>Nobody's around to see you.  Why not?</p></div>
	<div id="S5B2" class="B2"><p>There's probably a good reason not to go outside.</p></div>
	
		<div id="S6"><p class="storyElements">Pushing through the cat door, you step outside for the first time in your life. The morning mist has begun to burn away and the sun is drying the dew from the grass.  This was a great idea.  You continue walking until the grass meets a large dark forest. </p></div>
	<div id="S6B1" class="B1"><p>You decide to go into the forest.</p></div>
	<div id="S6B2" class="B2"><p>The forest is pretty scary.  Perhaps not.</p></div>
	
		<div id="S7"><p class="storyElements">You enter the dark forest. After wandering for a bit you discover a large fast river.  You wonder what's on the other side.</p></div>
	<div id="S7B1" class="B1"><p>You decide to swim across the river.</p></div>
	<div id="S7B2" class="B2"><p>You think against it. The water is moving pretty fast.</p></div>
	
		<div id="S8"><p class="storyElements">You play in the yard for a few hours chasing butterflies and leaves.  Then you notice a large road at the end of the grass. But you begin to think about your family back inside.</p></div>
	<div id="S8B1" class="B1"><p>You decide to go back inside.</p></div>
	<div id="S8B2" class="B2"><p>The road looks fun to cross!</p></div>
	
		<div id="S9"><p class="storyElements">Following the edge of the river you come to an edge of the edge of the forest.  You see a wide paved road.</p></div>
	<div id="S9B1" class="B1"><p>The cars look really scary.  It's probably too dangerous to cross.</p></div>
	<div id="S9B2" class="B2"><p>The other side of the road is filled with houses.  Perhaps one of them is yours. </p></div>
	
		<div id="S10"><p class="storyElements">You watch the road carefully, making sure there are no cars before you cross.  When the moment comes, you sprint as fast as you can across the pavement. Once safely on the other side, you realize none of these houses smell like your own.</p></div>
	<div id="S10B1" class="B1"><p>Lonley, you begin to cry loudly for your family.</p></div>
	<div id="S10B2" class="B2"><p>You wanter from house to house.</p></div>
	
		<div id="S12"><p class="storyElements">Each house begins to look like the house before it. You start to miss your family and wish you had never left home. You smell food coming from the next house.  Hungry you follow the smell.  You discover a large bowl of cat food on the porch.  After stuffing your face you realize there is a cat door next to the front door.</p></div>
	<div id="S12B1" class="B1"><p>Keep looking for your home.</p></div>
	<div id="S12B2" class="B2"><p>Go inside the cat door.</p></div>
	
	<div id="S11"><p class="storyElements">A strange human finds you. It is tall and scary.  But it bends down and makes clicking noises with its mouth while holding out a hand.</p></div>
	<div id="S11B1" class="B1"><p>Go closer to the human. It seems gentile.</p></div>
	<div id="S11B2" class="B2"><p>Don't trust the large human and keep running.</p></div>
	
	<div id="end1"><p class="storyElements">You then continue the rest of the day playing inside like a normal kitten.  At the end of the day you fall asleep with your family.</p></div>
	
	<div id="end2"><p class="storyElements">You jump in with a big splash.  Quickly the river sweeps you under the water. You squirm and gasp for air, but your lungs just fill with water.  The river throws you into a rock and everything goes dark.</p></div>
	
	<div id="end3"><p class="storyElements">Tired after a long day in the forest, you find your way back home.  You make your way back inside the kitty door.  Your mother and siblings rush up to you.  Your siblings crowd around you smelling all the new scents while your mother gives you a bath from head to toe.  Shortly after you curl up with your family and fall back asleep.</p></div>
	
	<div id="end4"><p class="storyElements">The human picks you up and brings you back to their home.  They look at your collar and talk to a strange object in their hand.  A little while later your human comes to the house and brings you back home.  Your mother and siblings rush up to you.  Your siblings crowd around you smelling all the new scents while your mother gives you a bath from head to toe.  Shortly after you curl up with your family and fall back asleep.</p></div>
	
	<div id="end5"><p class="storyElements">Inside you discover an elderly cat and a nice family of humans.  One of the humans looks at your collar and talks to a strange object in their hand.  A little while later your human comes to the house and brings you back home.  Your mother and siblings rush up to you.  Your siblings crowd around you smelling all the new scents while your mother gives you a bath from head to toe.  Shortly after you curl up with your family and fall back asleep.</p></div>
