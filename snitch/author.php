		<p class="first">Meet the author of the book, John Shelley. John's grew up in Keene, New Hampshire. His father was a Unitarian minister, and his mother a school teacher.
		<p class="first">His creative juices flowed early in his life but not as a writer. Instead he would invent things and build crazy contraptions out of other toys and would stay amused for hours.</p>
		<p class="first">As a teenager, he became a song writer, and as a young adult he would write ads for radio stations.</p>
		<p>For most of his adult life he has been a computer programmer which allowed him to use creative powers to develop specialized software for many different companies throughout the years.</p>
		<p>He married his wife Linda in 1991, and raised a family of four children. He loved playing games and reading to his kids, so it seems natural that he would invent the Bag-O-Loot game with his daughter ten years later.</p>
		<p>Becoming the author of the book was actually an accident. He had enlisted a young man in the summer of 2012 to pen the first book at the same time he had brought on the illustrator, Stefan Wollmar. Disaster struck, however, half way through the summer when things fell apart with the writer.</p>
		<p>Not wanting to give up, John and Stefan decided to buckle down and write an entirely different story using the artwork that had already been completed.</p>
		<p>The idea of writing the entire thing in rhyme was not a decision, but something that just started happening. John had always had a particular affection for books like "The Cat In The Hat" growing up, so he thought it would make the book extra fun to read and hear if he used a similar style.</p>
		<p>Now that the first book is done, he is very much looking forward to writing future books in the series, "The Adventures of Snitch the Fraccoon."</p>
