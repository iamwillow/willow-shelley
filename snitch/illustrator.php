	<p class="firstS">Meet the Illustrator for the book, Stefan Wollmar. Stefan grew up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. His father is an organic farmer, and his mother a Shambala Reiki Practitioner.</p>
	<p class="firstS">His life as an artist started early when he was just two years old. He got a hold of some crayons and drew his first mural on the wall of his house. His mother must have recognized his talent right away, never got upset and just encouraged him to use paper the next time.</p>
	<p>Stefan was working toward his degree in graphic design when he responded to a ad looking for someone to illustrate a new children's book. He saw this as a golden opportunity and a great way to put his career on the fast track to success.</p>
	<p>Although the pace was a bit intense - illustrating 36 pages in four months - he really enjoyed th work and is delighted with the outcome.</p>
	<p>He very much looks forward to starting book number two in 2013.</p>
